# 💻 Full Stack Developer Extraordinaire  

Hey there! 👋 I'm **Andres Bravo** a Full Stack Developer with **6+ years of experience** taming the wild beasts of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, and yes, even the mighty PHP with Laravel. 🚀  

I specialize in building scalable, efficient apps that are as fun to use as they are to build. From crafting sleek user interfaces to wrangling backend logic, I’ve got you covered! Currently, I’m on a mission to conquer the realms of **APIs, microservices, and gateways** using Laravel, Spring, and Node.js.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me chasing down bugs (literally and figuratively) or leveling up my skills with new tech adventures. Let’s build something awesome! 💪✨
